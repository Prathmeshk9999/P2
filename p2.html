       Napoleon I, French in full Napoléon Bonaparte, original Italian Napoleone Buonaparte, 
byname the Corsican or the Little Corporal, French byname Le Corse or Le Petit Caporal,
 (born August 15, 1769, Ajaccio, Corsica—died May 5, 1821, St. Helena Island), French general,
 first consul (1799–1804), and emperor of the French (1804–1814/15), one of the most celebrated 
personages in the history of the West. He revolutionized military organization and training; 
sponsored the Napoleonic Code, the prototype of later civil-law codes; reorganized education; 
and established the long-lived Concordat with the papacy.Napoleon’s many reforms left a lasting
 mark on the institutions of France and of much of western Europe. But his driving passion was
 the military expansion of French dominion, and, though at his fall he left France little larger than
 it had been at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he was almost unanimously revered during
 his lifetime and until the end of the Second Empire under his nephew Napoleon III as one of history’s
 great heroes.

      Napoleon was educated at three schools: briefly at<b> Autun</b>, for five years at the<b> military college of Brienne,</b>
 and finally for one year at the<b> military academy in Paris</b>. It was during Napoleon’s year in Paris that his 
father died of a stomach cancer in February 1785, leaving his family in straitened circumstances. Napoleon,
 although not the eldest son, assumed the position of head of the family before he was 16. In September he
 graduated from the military academy, ranking 42nd in a class of 58.He was made second lieutenant of artillery
 in the regiment of La Fère, a kind of training school for young artillery officers. Garrisoned at Valence, Napoleon
 continued his education, reading much, in particular works on strategy and tactics. He also wrote Lettres sur la
 Corse (“Letters on Corsica”), in which he reveals his feeling for his native island. He went back to Corsica in 
September 1786 and did not rejoin his regiment until June 1788. By that time the agitation that was to culminate 
in the French Revolution had already begun. A reader of Voltaire and of Rousseau, Napoleon believed that a political
 change was imperative, but, as a career officer, he seems not to have seen any need for radical social reforms.

When in 1789 the National Assembly, which had convened to establish a constitutional monarchy, allowed Paoli to
 return to Corsica, Napoleon asked for leave and in September joined Paoli’s group. But Paoli had no sympathy for 
the young man, whose father had deserted his cause and whom he considered to be a foreigner. Disappointed, 
Napoleon returned to France, and in April 1791 he was appointed first lieutenant to the 4th regiment of artillery, 
garrisoned at Valence. He at once joined the Jacobin Club, a debating society initially favouring a constitutional 
monarchy, and soon became its president, making speeches against nobles, monks, and bishops. In September 
1791 he got leave to go back to Corsica again for three months. Elected lieutenant colonel in the national guard, 
he soon fell out with Paoli, its commander in chief. When he failed to return to France, he was listed as a deserter 
in January 1792. But in April France declared war against Austria, and his offense was forgiven.
Apparently through patronage, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of captain but did not rejoin his regiment. 
Instead he returned to Corsica in October 1792, where Paoli was exercising dictatorial powers and preparing to 
separate Corsica from France. Napoleon, however, joined the Corsican Jacobins, who opposed Paoli’s policy. 
When civil war broke out in Corsica in April 1793, Paoli had the Buonaparte family condemned to “perpetual 
execration and infamy,” whereupon they all fled to France.

     Napoleon Bonaparte, as he may henceforth be called (though the family did not drop the spelling Buonaparte
 until after 1796), rejoined his regiment at Nice in June 1793. In his Le Souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire),
 written at this time, he argued vigorously for united action by all republicans rallied round the Jacobins, who 
were becoming progressively more radical, and the National Convention, the Revolutionary assembly that in the 
preceding fall had abolished the monarchy.At the end of August 1793, the National Convention’s troops had taken
 Marseille but were halted before Toulon, where the royalists had called in British forces. With the commander of 
the National Convention’s artillery wounded, Bonaparte got the post through the commissioner to the army, 
Antoine Saliceti, who was a Corsican deputy and a friend of Napoleon’s family. Bonaparte was promoted to major
 in September and adjutant general in October. He received a bayonet wound on December 16, but on the next day
 the British troops, harassed by his artillery, evacuated Toulon. On December 22 Bonaparte, age 24, was promoted
 to brigadier general in recognition of his decisive part in the capture of the town.

         Augustin de Robespierre, the commissioner to the army, wrote to his brother Maximilien, by then virtual head of 
the government and one of the leading figures of the Reign of Terror, praising the “transcendent merit” of the young
 republican officer. In February 1794 Bonaparte was appointed commandant of the artillery in the French Army of Italy
. Robespierre fell from power in Paris on 9 Thermidor, year II (July 27, 1794). When the news reached Nice, Bonaparte,
 regarded as a protégé of Robespierre, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy and treason. He was freed in September 
but was not restored to his command.
